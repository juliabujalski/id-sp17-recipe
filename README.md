# HTML & CSS Recipe

This repository corresponds to the Recipe Markup Style project. I decided to develop a page about Holy Cow Cake, a beloved family recipe. Through the development of this page, I experimented with learning about HTML and CSS while also making an aesthetically pleasing website. I utilized media skills to ensure the page is responsive for different screen sizes. I also made the recipe so that I could include images to supplement the written directions.
